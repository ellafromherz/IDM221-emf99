        <p class="about"> The final template of my Expressive Line Project for my class, Design I for Media. I  focused on manipulating line weight and type to create a dynamic abstract design.  I abstracted my initials to create dominant foreground designs, and used line repetitions (inspired by photos) to create subordinate background patterns.  I worked in two stages: formal sketches and final outcome.  In addition to showing different types of design, the thick-weight foreground design express the mood happy.   The final outcome consisted of both a hand drawn/inked layout of refined designs and a final digital layout of the best possible digital combinations of my foreground and background designs.</p>

        <h2>Shape and Pattern Project</h2>

        class="p2">
        <p class="about"> The final template of my Shape and Pattern Project for my class, Design I for Media.  In this project, I explored the tension of equivocal balance between black + white and positive + negative shapes.  I also explored ideas of balance through symmetry and asymmetry and using complex shapes to create a pattern with an ambiguous figure ground relationship. The project had three components: a hand-cut paper Notan, digital patterns with crops derived from my Notan, and a final concept design - making a digital composite of my pattern into a proposed space.</p>
        

        <h2>Value Translation Project</h2>
        <img
        alt="p3"
        height="275"
        src="images/2022_FA_P3_VALUE__Final_Template_150_Fromherz_E.jpg"
        width="375"
        class="p3">
        <p class="about"> The final template of my Value Translation Project for my class, Design I for Media.  I created a self-portrait that is inspired by a film-still of a portrait that I sourced from an assigned movie.  Once I chose my inspiration and using my own means - a camera, lighting, props, and mimicry, I did the best I could to recreate the pose, value, lighting, and expression in your selection.  Next, I digitally broke down the value pattern in black, white, and shades of gray in my image to fill into a grid.  I digitally added a color-coded system based on colors+ numbers that fills in the grid based on translating the values of my image into a coded map. This Map assisted me in identifying the value pattern.  Next, I created a value scale through adjusting images of different textures, along with nine different sketches that represented the photographed textures.  Finally, I used the posterized portrait and inserted my textures and sketches to create a portrait.

        <h2>Perspective Studies Project</h2>
        <img

        width="375"
        class="p4">
        <p class="about"> The final template of my Persoective Studies Project for my class, Design I for Media.  I began with painting a 9-step value scale using black and white acrylic paint.  I followed a series of instructions and tips to create a consistent grayscale with even gradations between steps.  Next, in Adobe Illustrator, I created digital designs keeping space in mind.  In pen and ink, I created a 1-point perspective study; and also created a 2-point perspective study that I painted with the colors that correlate with the original value scale.
